# 100 Days of Code: [Justice Udehegbunam](https://github.com/Justice-Udehegbunam)

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey! ðŸš€  
Iâ€™m diving deep into software development, not just to clone websites but to truly understand the **why** and **how** behind the code. My goal is to become a competent and creative frontend developer.

## Goals

- Reinforce the fundamentals of **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Next.js**.
- Move beyond simply cloning sites to mastering the principles of effective web development.
- Share daily progress and challenges faced.
- Build new projects and refine my skills.

### Commitment

Each day, Iâ€™ll create a new folder (`day-01`, `day-02`, etc.) to document:

- Key concepts learned.
- Code snippets or projects developed.
- Reflections on my learning journey and the challenges I face.
- What i didn't know earlier

### Why 100 Days?

I believe that true growth comes from understanding the fundamentals deeply, not just from replicating others' work. This challenge is about:

- Continuous learning in the tech space.
- Embracing failures and successes alike.
- Growing as a developer and individual, equipped with the knowledge to create innovative solutions.
