### üìÜ Daily Commitment

Each day, I‚Äôll create a new folder (`day-01`, `day-02`, etc.) to document:

- Key concepts learned
- Code snippets or projects developed
- Reflections on my learning journey and challenges faced

---

### üí° Why 100 Days?

True growth comes from understanding fundamentals deeply, not just replicating others' work. This challenge focuses on:

- Continuous tech learning
- Embracing both successes and failures
- Growing as a developer and innovator
