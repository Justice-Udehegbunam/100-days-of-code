# 100 Days of Code: [Justice Udehegbunam](https://github.com/Justice-Udehegbunam)

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey! ðŸš€  
Iâ€™m diving deep into software development, not just to clone websites but to truly understand the **why** and **how** behind the code. My goal is to become a versatile, competent and creative frontend developer.

## Goals

- Reinforce the fundamentals of **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Next.js**.
- Learn Wordpress
- Move beyond simply cloning sites to mastering the principles of effective web development.
- Share progress and challenges faced.
- Strengthen my portfolioand skills.
- Gain clarity on my path to the job market.
- Build new projects and refine my skills.

## Progress Tracker

This is a daily log of my progress through 100 days of code, where I focus on honing my skills, learning new concepts, and working on various projects.

### Notes on Projects

#### Notes App

- Created a command-line application for managing notes using Node.js.
- Learned how to use `fs` for file handling, `chalk` for text styling, and `yargs` for argument parsing.

#### Weather App

- Developed a weather forecasting app with Node.js that uses geocoding and weather APIs.
- Learned callback patterns, error handling, and modularization for cleaner code structure.

### Certifications and Resources

- Currently enrolled in Coursera for further learning and certification in relevant fields.

### Commitment

Each day, Iâ€™ll create a new folder (`day-01`, `day-02`, etc.) to document:

- Key concepts learned.
- Code snippets or projects developed.
- Reflections on my learning journey and the challenges I face.
- What i didn't know earlier

### Why 100 Days?

I believe that true growth comes from understanding the fundamentals deeply, not just from replicating others' work. This challenge is about:

- Continuous learning in the tech space.
- Embracing failures and successes alike.
- Growing as a developer and individual, equipped with the knowledge to create innovative solutions.
