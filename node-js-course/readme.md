# Complete Node.js Developer Course

This is a udemy course i got thought by [Andrew Mead](mead.io) that really has been rated high and i hope it solidifies my node knowledge.

## What is Node.js ?

Node is a way to run javascript on the server as opposed to being forced to run it on the client that is just built on chrome V8 js engine.

The chrome V8 engine and node are basically written in c++
This is what allows chrome to interact with the DOM because technically the DOM isnt part of javascript and also it is what allows node to interaact with the file-system when also the file system isnt part of js either

## Why i am learning Node.js Again ?

- Because of its strong demand even in todays market
- because of its non-blocking I/O
- I need it for my interactive comments section app

Essentially every file you create is basically a module in node.js with its own scope just like how a function is given its own scope

# Notes App Documentation

So yea for over a week i was working on a notes application that uses the fs (File System), chalk and JSON to Create, Read Update and Delete notes on the Json file based on Command Line Arguments passed on the terminal

## What did I learn

- I learnt that chalk is a really good package to be able to use to display terminal messages in a more easy to understand fashion
- I learnt also that "--" in node/terminal is use to tell the application that this is a Command Line Argument (or CLA's as i like to call them).
- Yargs offer built in support for properly parsing command line arguments.
- Learnt new yargs methods

All in all i learnt a lot so i guess to the next one!
