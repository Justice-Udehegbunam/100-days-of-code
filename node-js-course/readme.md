# Complete Node.js Developer Course

This is a udemy course i got thought by [Andrew Mead](mead.io) that really has been rated high and i hope it solidifies my node knowledge.

## What is Node.js ?

Node is a way to run javascript on the server as opposed to being forced to run it on the client that is just built on chrome V8 js engine.

The chrome V8 engine and node are basically written in c++
This is what allows chrome to interact with the DOM because technically the DOM isnt part of javascript and also it is what allows node to interaact with the file-system when also the file system isnt part of js either

## Why i am learning Node.js Again ?

- Because of its strong demand even in todays market
- because of its non-blocking I/O
- I need it for my interactive comments section app

Essentially every file you create is basically a module in node.js with its own scope just like how a function is given its own scope
