# 100 Days of Code – Eloquent JavaScript Journey

## Current Status

I'm on **Day 8** of my 100 Days of Code challenge and have reached **Chapter 7** of _Eloquent JavaScript_. However, I’ve decided to take a break from progressing through the book and focus on applying what I’ve learned by working on projects from **Frontend Mentor**.

### What I’ve Covered So Far

- **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Mastering basic data types, functions, and control flow.
- **Data Structures:** Learning to use arrays and objects to handle collections of data.
- **OOP Concepts:** Understanding classes, methods, and the principles of encapsulation and abstraction.
- **Algorithm Design:** Implementing and optimizing routing algorithms for simulated environments.

### Projects Completed

1. **FizzBuzz Pattern Generator**
2. **Chessboard Pattern Builder**
3. **Robot Task Solver**

Each project reinforced key concepts like control flow, object-oriented design, and algorithm efficiency.

## Next Steps

- **Practical Application:** I’ll be focusing on completing frontend projects from **Frontend Mentor** to deepen my understanding and practical skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and UI/UX design.
- **Goal for the Week:** Apply the knowledge gained from the book so far, particularly in JavaScript classes and Array manipulation, to real-world projects.
