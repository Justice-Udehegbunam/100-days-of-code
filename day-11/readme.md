# DAY 11-14 Challenge

So yh uhhm during the course of my project build back in day 9. I ran into a problem of using local storage and how to handle it properly so i said instead of doing what i usually do (ask chatgPT for help ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), why dont i take the long route of actually understanding the many intricasies it has and other topics preceeding it.

So wish me luck
