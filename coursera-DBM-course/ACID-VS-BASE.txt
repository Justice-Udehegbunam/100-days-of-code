ACID Model
The ACID model is a set of properties ensuring reliable transactions in relational databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL).

ACID Properties:
Atomicity: Ensures that all parts of a transaction are completed; if any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

Example: In a bank transfer, both debit and credit operations occur together, or neither happens.
Consistency: Guarantees that a transaction moves the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules (e.g., constraints).

Example: After a transaction, no data integrity rules (like foreign keys) are violated.
Isolation: Ensures that transactions operate independently without interference, so concurrent transactions don’t affect each other's outcome.

Example: A query doesn’t see partial updates from a transaction still in progress.
Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even if a system crash occurs.

Example: After a purchase is confirmed, it remains confirmed even if the system goes down right after.
Use Cases: ACID is ideal for applications requiring high accuracy and consistency, like banking, finance, or online stores.

BASE Model
The BASE model is often applied to NoSQL databases designed for high scalability and availability, making some trade-offs on consistency.

BASE Properties:
Basically Available: The system guarantees availability, even in cases where some nodes fail.

Example: A NoSQL database may allow reads and writes even if one of the replicas is down.
Soft State: The state of the system may change over time, even without new transactions due to eventual synchronization between nodes.

Example: Data might appear outdated temporarily until it’s updated in all replicas.
Eventual Consistency: The system will become consistent over time, but immediate consistency across all nodes is not guaranteed.

Example: After updating a record, it might take a few seconds for that change to appear across all nodes.
Use Cases: BASE is ideal for high-availability applications that can tolerate temporary inconsistencies, like social media platforms, e-commerce recommendations, and large-scale data streaming services.
