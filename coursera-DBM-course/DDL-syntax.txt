Data Definition Language (DDL)
The SQL DDL category provides commands for defining, deleting and modifying tables in a database. Use the following commands in this category.

CREATE Command

Syntax to create a table with three columns:
CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name1 datatype(size), column_name2 datatype(size), column_name3 datatype(size));

DROP Command 

Purpose: To delete a database or a table inside the database. 

Syntax to drop a table:
DROP TABLE table_name;


ALTER Command 

Purpose: To change the structure of the tables in the database such as changing the name of a table, adding a primary key to a table, or adding or deleting a column in a table.

Syntax to alter a table
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD (column_name datatype(size));
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD primary key (column_name);


TRUNCATE Command

Purpose: To remove all records from a table, which will empty the table but not delete the table itself.

COMMENT Command

Purpose: To add comments to explain or document SQL statements by using double dash (--) at the start of the line. Any text after the double dash will not be executed as part of the SQL statement. These comments are not there to build the database. They are only for your own use.
