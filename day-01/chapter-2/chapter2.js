// PROGRAMS STRUCTURE

// Variables:  A variable is originally thought as a container but this is wrong instead it should be thought as a "binding" (i.e binding a variable name to a value or the result of an operation)

/* A single let keyword can beused to declare many variables/bindimgs but it has to be seperated by commas

let bisi = 1,  tolu = 3
*/

/* List of names u cant use for variables 

break case catch class const continue debugger default
delete do else enum export extends false finally for
function if implements import interface in instanceof let
new package private protected public return static super
switch this throw true try typeof var void while with yield
*/
let protected = "garri";
//console.log(implements);

/* ENVIRONMENT
An environment is basically a collection of in-built bindings  */

/* let b = 1;
while (b <= 10000) {
  //console.log(b);
  //b += 1;
}

/* HOW TO DO RAISE TO POWER IN JS */
// const tenthPower = 2 ** 10; // this is the same as saying 2^10 in english

// console.log(tenthPower);

/* for loop syntax

workload;}  */
